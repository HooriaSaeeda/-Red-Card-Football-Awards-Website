## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5**: Markup structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for layout, fonts, and colors.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive grid structure and utility classes.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for text styling.

### What I learned

Working on this project helped deepen my understanding of responsive design, particularly:

- **Bootstrap Grid** : I used the grid system extensively to arrange content across different screen sizes, learning more about adjusting columns and spacing dynamically.
- **Media Queries** : Writing custom media queries to override Bootstrap and control layout shifts helped me refine my approach to mobile and tablet views.
- **Typography and Spacing** : Finding the right font weights and sizes for readability while maintaining the aesthetic required balancing utility classes and custom styles.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Implement more dynamic, data-driven elements such as awards data pulled from JSON or a CMS.
- Experiment with CSS animations to make the page more interactive, especially for highlighting award categories.
- Focus on improving accessibility with proper ARIA roles and a more comprehensive color contrast strategy.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - Invaluable for learning about responsive grid layout and utilities.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Great resource for enhancing typography.
